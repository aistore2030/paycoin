## Motivation
I wanted to learn better the bitcoin internals and thought building
a mental model in Javascript is a good way of elaboration to burn it
into my memory. I also thought my newcomer questions and the answers
I found for them can help other newcomers. The code is deliberately
simple, maybe "simpler" is more true because lots of advanced features
are not implemented for the sake of learning easily(I learned these
things, I didn't put them for you to learn better).

I would be really happy if you send a pull request if you see my mistake
or you think there is a better way of teaching things.

Project is incomplete now, just at the phase of creating a mental model
but still a good reference to learn.
